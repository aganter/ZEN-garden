5 supply chain designs for different levels of hydrogen demand. 
- min: minimal hydrogen demand reported in literature (ammonia, refineries, methanol)
- td: technology diversification (ammonia, refineries, methanol, some steel industry)
- ref.: reference scenario (ammonia, refineries, methanol, steel, some cement)
- h2push: hydrogen push scenario, ambitious scenario (ammonia, refineries, methanol, steel, some cement)
- max: maximum hydrogen demand reported in literature (ammonia, refineries, methanol, steel, some cement)

in each scenario, full decarbonization by 2050 has to be achieved. A linear decarbonization pathway is assumed.
In addition, in 2030 the EU fit for 55 target has to be realized.

For the set of technologies, take a look at system.
